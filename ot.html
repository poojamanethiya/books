	<p><b><i>REVIEW:</i> This story revolves around katherine who is shrewish and seems to hate man, this story is somewhat funny as petruccio tries to make katherina an obedient wife , but in mostly parts of his trying he just do embarrassing acts or act wierdly , overall the story is entertaining.</b></p>
