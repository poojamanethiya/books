		<header>THE CRIMES OF GRINDELWALD </header>
	<div ><p><b>
	 Grindelwald has made a dramatic escape from MACUSA custody.
	   The villainous Grindelwald has been busy gathering more followers 
	to his cause – elevating wizards above all non-magical beings.
	 The only one who might be able to stop him is the wizard he once 
	called his dearest friend, Albus Dumbledore. But Dumbledore will need 
help from the wizard who had thwarted Grindelwald once before, his former
 student Newt Scamander. Newt will again be joined by Queenie and Tina 
Goldstein in the next film, as well as his No-Maj friend, Jacob Kowalski.
 However, the mission against Grindelwald will ‘test their loyalties’ as 
the wizarding world becomes more divided and dangerous.<br><br>
	<i><b>REVIEW:</b></i>
	As a fan of wizarding world , i have watched all parts of harry potter 
	, and then the fantastic beasts and where to find them , added new perspective
	 to wizarding world and so this book is just amazing and interesting one full 
	 of adventure and twists.and as it is a story of wizard world before harry potter , 
	 it is like 
	exploring a whole new view of the series
	 of fantastic beasts .
